      My name is Mauro and I work as a motion designer, actually freelancing
      around London, UK. You can have a look at my portfolio here: <a

      >.

    <h3 id="music">Music</h3>

    <p>
      I also have a lifelong passion for music, jazz and its round abouts in
      particular but I tend to discover interesting new stuff pretty often in
      various other genres.

    <h3 id="mastodon">Mastodon</h3>

    <p>
      Along with my many interests I actually run a <a
        href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a
      > server on <a href="https://mograph.social">mograph.social</a>. This is
      an experiment aimed at trying to build a space for motion designers, VFX
      artists and similar outside of the mainstream platforms like Twitter or
      Facebook and bring some visual excitment into the <a
        href="https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse/">Fediverse</a
      >.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3 id="this-website">This website</h3>

    <p>
      The idea with this website is to create a repository of a few things I
      discover in any of the fields Iâ€™m interested in, be it motion design,
      music, privacy, PKM systems (Personal Knowledge Management).
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, I might use this space to post some work in progress and experiments
      I do with moving (or static) images.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, I wish this space to become a little piece of the web for myself
      in the spirit of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>.
