        Technical details of my personal website.
      </p>
      <h2>How this website is made</h2>
      <p>
        This website is made of static files generated with the help of the <a
          href="https://astro.build/">AstroJS</a
        > framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not using any framework for the styling though, which is made
        entirely with vanilla CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only JavaScript present on the actual hosted site is the code used
        to switch the light/dark theme, other than that what you're looking at
        are just HTML and CSS files.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's using <a href="https://fonts.bunny.net/">BunnyFonts</a>'s CDN
        network to get fonts (and avoid Google).
      </p>
      <h2>Design specs</h2>
      <p>
        The typeface for the headings and general sans serif text is <a
          href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a
        >. The typeface used for paragraphs is <a
          href="https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-serif/">Source Serif 4</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overall design of this website, including the colour palette, is
        inspired by the work of <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams">Dieter Rams</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h2>How this website is hosted</h2>
      <p>
        The website's source code is hosted on <a
          href="https://github.com/mauromotion/mauromotion_com">GitHub</a
        >, which is then linked to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a
        > that deals with launching the build process that generates the static files,
        and then proceeds to host them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The domain is on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Plans for the future</h2>
      <p>
        The more I learn about (self) hosting and deploying the more I want to
        move this website to a more "traditional" service. I'm thinking either <a
          href="https://www.mythic-beasts.com/">Mythic Beasts</a
        > or <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. That would be
        pretty straight forward to do, and I won't have to rely on corporations
        to host my personal stuff, at least.
