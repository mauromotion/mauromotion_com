You're officially reading this blog post on my brand new personal website!

I need to thank my partner Flavia for helping me with the design, which is inspired by the work of [Dieter Rams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams), mostly for the colour palette and the minimalism.
I really tried to choose some good fonts for readability, since a blog at the end of the day is meant to be read, and I hope you like my choices.
It's using [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) for the titles (a classic choice), and [Cambo](https://huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/cambo-ht) for the rest of the text, a humanistic serif font.

<br>

I'm gonna write a proper Colophon I think but for the curious folks I built the website using the framework [Astro](https://astro.build/) and styled it with vanilla CSS.
For the moment the website is hosted and deployed using both GitHub and Netlify, which is a choice I'm not very fond of, but it really helped me shipping the website fast. It's not ideal because I'd rather not rely on corporations to store and use my own data, but for the moment that'll do, I'll move to something like [Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/) in the future.

<br>

If anyone was following via RSS unfortunately they'll have to fix the URL to my feeds because it has changed.

<br>

Now my excuses not to blog are very scarce...It's nice to use something made by hand by yourself. I'll try to keep up the blog posts on a proper pace!

<br>

Thanks!
<br>
Mauro.
