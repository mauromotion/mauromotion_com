I just added a [/uses](/uses.html) page to my website. It's a list of most of the software, services, and devices that I'm currently using on a daily basis.

I tried to be as much as privacy-conscious as possible (without throwing my smartphone from the window, that is) so if you're interested in alternative services to the Big Corps offer you may find something useful in here.
