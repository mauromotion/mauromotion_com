With a complete and very unexpected 180 degrees turnaround from my [previous blog post](/posts/2025-04-16-doom-emacs-orgmode), I've become an avid [Emacs](https://github.com/mauromotion/dotfiles/blob/main/common/emacs/config.org) user. I've literally replaced any type of writing software with it. Except for actual development. I don't do much dev work lately but for it I'm still reliant on my Neovim setup as an IDE. I could just use Emacs for that as well honestly, I just haven't gone that far yet.

As I wrote before, I started by trying out [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/), and not liking it at first. Don't get me wrong, I now think that it's a great showcase of what modern Emacs can offer, and there's a lot of stuff to dig into it and even copy. But in general it really is just someone else's Emacs setup, and it feels like it.

So I wanted to start from scratch, but the way there is quite long and intricate. I therefore started by following [System Crafters](https://systemcrafters.net/)' great YouTube playlist "[Emacs From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ)", where David builds a complete Emacs configuration... from scratch, showcasing the whole process.

It was a great introduction and source of knowledge and understanding, but I soon discovered that most of the packages that David was using in the videos a few years ago have been mostly replaced by more modern versions, new packages that leverage Emacs defaults rather than adding too many extra layers of code and complexity, from what I understand.

Most of all I'm thinking about the stack for completion and selection that is now built on consult, vertico, marginalia and orderless, instead of the more "classic" ivy and counsel packages. And so I restarted...from scratch once again, by myself this time, with the acquired knowledge, and managed to get a working Emacs config that completely suits my needs without being (too much) over encumbered by useless packages and functionalities.

In the end I've completely embraced [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) for all my note taking, and general writing. I started to rebuild my Logseq system (that followed the [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)) with [Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/), but I soon migrated to the more apt (to my use case at least) [Denote](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote) package from the good [Prot](https://protesilaos.com/). Unlike Org-roam, Denote doesn't use a database at all, it relies entirely on regex for searching, but its naming convention is so flexible it's just great, and worth the trade off. And I have yet to experience any lag or sluggishness anyway.

I've built a simple dashboard to collect at a glance all my journaling posts in a timely order, similar to Logseq. Also I made a general index that keeps track of all my current interests under the PARA method. It just works great, it's so powerful that the more I use it the better it gets. A feature that I use a lot from Denote that I couldn't make use of in Org-roam are [dblocks](https://orgmode.org/manual/Dynamic-Blocks.html) (dynamic blocks), which are natively implemented in Org-mode, and on which Denote expands upon. I can have a semi-auto updating network of notes, references, and backlinks which is very useful.

Another package that I really like is [elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed), which is an RSS feed reader for Emacs. It's very minimalistic, and very clear, the most distraction-free RSS
reader I've ever used, and again, like most things in emacs, quite customisable.

In a frenzy of trying things out inside Emacs, or like they say, to try and live
inside Emacs, I gave a try also to an email client ([mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html)) but honestly it's not for me, all my emails are in HTML, and I don't receive enough plain text messages to justify the struggle of reading parsed HTML emails inside Emacs. But I know that a lot of people find it useful and I can see why, if your workflow is around plain text emails.

I gave a shot at IRC clients as well, at some point. I don't use the IRC chats
too much to be honest, but the client I ended up using, which for me worked out
of the box, is [circe](https://github.com/emacs-circe/circe). Honestly, it feels
literally like a jump back in the early 2000s, if not late 90s, which is a bit
too much for me. A lot of programs and workflows got worse, that's definitely
something I can agree with. But a lot of progress has also been made into user
interfaces and user interactions, we gotta give credit to that, I believe.

Something I wasn't expecting but that I enjoy a lot instead, is using proportional fonts instead of the usual monospace fonts used in command line applications. It took me quite a lot of set up and trial and error to get it working the way I like it, but now my Emacs looks and feels great. I still use a monospace font for code and code blocks obviously, but writing (and reading) with a proportional font is very nice, much more natural.
Of course I rely on vim keybindings via evil-mode, like Doom Emacs does. I just can't live without them now.

Overall I've been using Emacs for over 6 months, and I love it. I didn't know it could feel so "modern" whilst being one of the oldest pieces of software out there. I just love it, and I don't think I could turn back now. It feels very "mine" and cosy to use.
I also have to say that more than just a good piece of software, what I enjoy the most of Emacs is its philosophy and its community. I was able to know the work of so many inspirational folks out there, I just couldn't know the existence of without my journey through Emacs. From the already mentioned [System Crafter](https://systemcrafters.net/)'s community lead by the awesome David, and [Protesilaos Stavrou](https://protesilaos.com/), to many other curious and smart minds that I discover daily via either the Emacs community on Mastodon, Reddit or the [Planet Emacslife](https://planet.emacslife.com/) RSS feed.

By the way, here's my [literal Emacs configuration](https://github.com/mauromotion/dotfiles/blob/main/common/emacs/config.org), if you're curious about the packages I use, and some of my custom functions.

And that's it folks. This is how I finally entered the Church of Emacs!
