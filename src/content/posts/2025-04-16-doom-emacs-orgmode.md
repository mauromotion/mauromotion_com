I've been (yet once again) trying [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) these days; in fact I'm still
watching a [great series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhXZp00uXBk4np17N39WvB80zgxlZfVwj) of video tutorials on it.

But there are several factors that won't make me stick with it:

- (Doom) Emacs is slow as hell.
- [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) is very cool but I don't need yet another syntax for notes,
  markdown is good enough.
- Org-mode is great but I don't feel the need to manage my life and tasks in such
  great detail, in fact pen and paper are more than sufficient for me at the
  moment.
- The Emacs ecosystem is way too much to absorb, and I'm not even an "expert"
  at neovim (yet).
- My neovim setup is so well refined, I just prefer it.
- I'd just use Doom Emacs for Org-mode really, and it kinda feels like using a
  space ship to hammer down a nail.
- (Doom) Emacs is slow as hell.

I tried the [nvim-orgmode](https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode) plugin, and it's kinda cool but it's not polished
enough yet, I think; and also the documentation is not up to speed with the
development of neovim or other plugins (blink-cmp), unfortunately.
But I'm keeping it in my neovim config for the time being, I like the org-agenda
view too much, I just need to open it up from time to time.

And again, having to deal with yet another syntax just for taking notes and todo
lists seems a bit overkill honestly.

I'll stick with [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) for now, and [taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) for my task management when I
feel the need.
