Last weekend I started learning a new keyboard layout. Just because.

I've been using [colemak-dh](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) for over a year now, probably a year an a half, and it's been definitely an improvement over qwerty in terms of ergonomics, that's for sure.
But I'm curious about more modern layouts, how they feel, how I perform with them.

Looking at [r/KeyboardLayouts](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts) there are a few contenders, but the most agreed upon are a couple that are quite similar: [Gallium](https://github.com/GalileoBlues/Gallium/) and [Graphite](https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout). They are similar because they have been both created with some algorithmic analysis around the same time (about 2 years ago, so around 2023).

They are supposedly very "balanced", and they avoid some typical issues that other layouts have that make typing certain words a bit too convoluted (looking at "you" and "was" in colemak).

At a first glance it seems that they might have some issues of themselves, but no layout is perfect. In particular I can see a group of letters clustered together that would make typing certain words quite challenging (mostly words that include the couple "ph"), but I'll see how it goes. Lots of people are really liking these new layouts, despite this quirk.

I'm going with Gallium because there is a version of it specifically made for columnar keyboards (which I use), and also I've noticed the "j" and "k" letters in the same position as colemak-dh, not sure if it's a pro or a cons yet, but it feels safe. Especially for the vim motions.

Also I'm not a fan of the positioning of the apostrophe symbol in the Graphite layout, which is in the middle of the top row. Too alien for my taste. Graphite also has an emphasis on staggered layouts, which again, I don't really use except from my laptop from time to time. The emphasis is on using the hands in an angular position which is more comfortable on traditional keyboards. But I guess Gallium is similar in this regard? Again, I use split keyboards anyway, so I don't really care about this feature.

Once again I'm using [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/) to burn in my memory all the letters, and it's kinda nice re-experiencing the feeling of scrambling my brain cells and my fingers' muscle memory. I wasn't expecting to say something like that, but that's it. Also, there's definitely something in the process that my brain has learned, because this time it feels less of a struggle, almost enjoyable.

I guess I like to test my neuroplasticity from time to time.
